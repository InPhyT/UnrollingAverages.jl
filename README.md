UnrollingAverages is a Julia package aimed at *reversing* (or *unrolling*) moving averages of time series to get the original ones back.

UnrollingAverages currently assumes that the moving average is a [simple moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Simple_moving_average). Further relaxations and extensions may come in the future, see [Future Developments](#Future-Developments) section.

## Installation

Press `]` in the Julia REPL and then

```julia
pkg> add UnrollingAverages
```

## Usage

The package exports a single function called `unroll`: it returns a `Vector` whose elements are the possible original time series.

```julia
unroll(moving_average::Vector{Float64}, window::Int64; initial_conditions::U = nothing, assert_natural::Bool = false) where { U <: Union{ Tuple{Vararg{Union{Int64,Float64}}},Nothing} }
```

### Arguments

- `moving_average`: the time series representing the moving average to unroll ;
- `window`: the width of the moving average ;
- `initial_conditions`: the initial values of the original time series to be recovered. It may be a `Tuple` of `window-1` positive integer values, or `nothing` if initial conditions are unknown. Currently it is not possible to specify values in the middle of the time series, this may be a feature to be added in the future ;
- `assert_natural` default boolean argument. If true, the pipeline will try to recover a time series of natural numbers only. More then one acceptable time series (where "acceptable" means that it reproduces `moving_average`) may be found and all will be returned.

A few remarks:

1. If `isnothing(initial_conditions)`:
   - `if assert_natural`, then an internal `unroll_iterative` method is called, which tries to exactly recover the whole time series, initial conditions included. Enter `?UnrollingAverages.unroll_iterative` in a Julia  to read further details;
   - `if !assert_natural`, then an internal `unroll_linear_approximation` method is called. See this [StackExchange post](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/68002). NB: this is an approximated method, it will generally not return the exact original time series;
2. If `typeof(initial_conditions) <: Ntuple{window-1, <:Union{Int64,Float64}}`, then an internal `unroll_recursive` method is called, which exactly recovers the time series. Mathematical details about this function are reported in the [documentation](https://InPhyT.github.io/UnrollingAverages.jl/stable), and you may read more by entering `?UnrollingAverages.unroll_recursive`.

## Future Developments

- Modify `initial_conditions` argument of `unroll` so that it accepts known values throughout the series ;
- Implement reversing methods for other types of moving averages .
